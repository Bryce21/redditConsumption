Idea:


Get data from subreddits. Still need to figure that out


Produce that data to kafka. Raw json of the reddit post

Read that data in part3.spark streaming. Process it.

Output back to another kafka topic or straight to elasticsearch
Kibana dashboard to explain data

Optional:
Use scalajs to make react dashboard to show data?



Steps:
Get containers setup
    Spark
    Kafka
Get some example data of reddit posts to figure out layout
Have some manual scripts to produce that data
Get part3.spark consuming from kafka
Produce to elasticsearch



// Maybe save the data to different indices?

index = subredditName
